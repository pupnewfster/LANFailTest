# LANFailTest

Steps to reproduce:
1. Launch a client run config
2. Create a new world (existing is fine as well)
3. Open to LAN (I defaullted gamemode to creative)
4. Launch a second client run config
5. Join the first client's world via the open LAN server
6. Build a nether portal
7. Have the second client go through the nether portal to the nether (most times this is fine and won't cause issues)
8. Have the second client re-enter the nether portal to try and come back to the overworld (this seems to reliably cause the disconnect)
